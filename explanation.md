##Introduction
**What is the meaning of browser?**<br>

By the time you are reading this article, certainly you are already using a web browser which is presenting this article content in a rich text/graphical format on your computer or phone screen.

A web browser or frequently called as browser is an application software that is installed on a computer to provide access to the World Wide Web. It fetches the web pages from the server along with the necessary files like, images, flashes, videos etc, interprets them and then displays it on the screen. All you have to do is simply type the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of a webpage in the address bar and the browser will bring the web page on your screen.

In this tutorial we will see what happens when you type google.com in the address bar until you see the Google page on the browser screen.

##Structure of Browsers
The browser’s main functionality is to fetch the files from the server and to display them on the screen. It basically displays html files containing images, PDF, videos, flashes, etc in an ordered layout. A browser is a group of structured codes that performs plenty of tasks to display a webpage on the screen. These codes are separated in to different components according to their tasks performed. The structure of a browser is shown in the below image.

### Installation
Detailed guides are available at [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md).

1. Download and unarchive a file from [release page](http://github.com/mattermost/desktop/releases).
2. Launch `Mattermost` in the unarchived folder.
3. After first launching, please input name and URL for your Mattermost team. For example, `myteam : https://mattermost.example.com/team`.

### Quit

This contains the main components of a browser. They Include:<br>

**1. The User Interface**<br>
Browser user interfaces have a lot in common with each other. Among the common user interface elements are:
1. Address bar for inserting a URI
2. Back and forward buttons
3. Bookmarking options
4. Refresh and stop buttons for refreshing or stopping the loading of current documents
5. Home button that takes you to your home page

**2. The Browser Engine**<br>
A web browser engine (sometimes called layout engine or rendering engine) is a program that renders marked up content (such as HTML, XML, image files, etc.) and formatting information (such as CSS, XSL, etc.). It marshals actions between the UI and the rendering engine.<br>

**3. The Rendering Engine**<br>
It is responsible for displaying requested content. For example if the requested content is HTML, the rendering engine parses HTML and CSS, and displays the parsed content on the screen.<br>
By default the rendering engine can display HTML and XML documents and images. It can display other types of data via plug-ins or extension; for example, displaying PDF documents using a PDF viewer plug-in. However, in this chapter we will focus on the main use case: displaying HTML and images that are formatted using CSS.<br>

**4. Networking**<br>
Used for network calls such as HTTP requests, using different implementations for different platform behind a platform-independent interface.<br>

**5. UI Backend**<br>
Used for drawing basic widgets like combo boxes and windows. This backend exposes a generic interface that is not platform specific. Underneath it uses operating system user interface methods.<br>

**6. JavaScript Interpreter**<br>
Used to parse and execute JavaScript code.<br>

**7. Data storage**<br>
This is a persistence layer. The browser may need to save all sorts of data locally, such as cookies. Browsers also support storage mechanisms such as localStorage, IndexedDB, WebSQL and FileSystem.

##Putting it All Together
As seen a browser has a UI, when you navigate to a URL in the address bar you are making a “request” for the content at that URL.

That URL you typed into the address bar maps to an IP address. This is called a DNS lookup. DNS stands for “Domain Name System” and it maps numeric computer addresses to human readable names. All computers have an IP address. You can find out your personal computer’s IP address by typing “ifconfig” into your terminal window and looking for the number that is displayed in dot decimal format, such as 000.000.000.000. (Note that 127.0.0.1 is used in your computer internally to refer to itself).

For example, one IP address for Google is 74.125.134.102. You can enter 74.125.134.102 in the address bar and it will show the contents at www.google.com.

Once the browser has the IP address it sends an HTTP request to the web server at that address. HTTP stands for “Hypertext Transfer Protocol” and is used to facilitate requests from your client (the browser) and responses from the server. In our case the response is HTML from the web server at www.google.com.

As this HTML response is being sent to your browser, the browser’s rendering engine is displaying the requested content on your screen. To accomplish this the rendering engine “parses” the HTML and creates a DOM tree.

The browser then parses style data (CSS or inline styles) and together with the HTML it constructs a render tree. The render tree displays rectangles (that represent divs, paragraphs, headlines, etc.) with a few visual attributes such as color and size dimensions. These rectangles are displayed in order on the page. Next, the browser lays out the contents in the position they will appear in the browser. The last step is “painting” where the elements are drawn on the screen.

As the browser is rendering the HTML it will find tags (like our link tag and our img tag) that require files from other URLs. The browser will send a request to the web server to get each of these files.
